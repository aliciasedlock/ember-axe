# ember-axe

This is currently just a simple hook-up for [Deque Labs'](https://github.com/dequelabs)
[axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility testing engine.

## Future Plans

Future plans for this are to have the `a11yCheck` run automatically during
acceptance tests and to integrate it into components for checks during
development.
